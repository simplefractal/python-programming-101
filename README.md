# python-programming-101
The objective of this course is to give students a solid foundation in python, which they can use to build for the web or do data science, data analytics and much, much more.

# Exercise Set 1: Strings
- Set a variable called `name` equal to your full name.
- Set a variable called `first_name` equal to your first name.
- Set a variable called `last_name` equal to your last name.
- Then combine `first_name` and `last_name` so that it equals your full name, and save this in a variable called `full_name`.
- Prove using the == operator that they are equal.

# Exercise Set 2: Lists
- Create a list called `restaurants` consisting of the following elements in this order:
"Laut", "Random String", "Chipotle", "Eataly", "Sophie's Cuban", "Chop't", "Potbelly's"
- Get the third element of the list
- Add "Ootoya" to the end of the list
- Use .pop() to remove "Random String" from the list
- Print the list
- Check if 'Chipotle' is in the list
- Check if 'Random String' is in the list
- Get the length of the list

# Exercise Set 3: Dictionaries
Create a dictionary called `class_data` with the following keys:
- "course_name", which should correspond to "Python Programming 101"
- "student_count", which should correspond to number of students, say 20
- "instructor", which should itself be a dictionary with the following keys
    - "name" ("Suneel")
    - "can_program" (True)
- get the student count from the dictionary
- get the instructor name from the dictionary

# Exercise Set 4: If / Else
Given `x = "John Adams"`,

- Construct an if else statement according to this logic: if "John" is in x, print "John is in x", otherwise print "John is not in x"
- Construct an if/elif/else statement according to this logic: if "roger" is in x, print "Hi Roger!", elif the length of x is greater than 20, print "thats a long string", else print "Oh well!"

# Exercise Set 5: For Loops
- Construct a list of numbers between 0 and 1000 that are divisible by 33
- Given the following list `["Donald Duck", "Mickey Mouse", "Daffy Duck", "Goofy", "Minnie Mouse", "Pluto"]`, get the sum of all of the lengths of these strings.

# Exercise Set 6: Functions
- create a function `multiply` that takes two variables and returns their product
- create a function that converts a Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit

# Exercise Set 7: Other Libraries
- create a function using the random library that randomly recommends a lunch spot from a list of restaurants but never recommends the same lunch spot twice in a row
